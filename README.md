# movieflix

This is a simple react application that fetches data from the omdb api.
You can search the name of the movies in the search bar and the omdb api returns the list of related data.
To run this in your local machine:
1. Clone the repo in your local system.
2. Gather the required api keys and credentials as given in the env example file.
3. Install the required dependencies - materialUI, react-router-dom, firebase.
4. I have used firebase for authentication.
5. Use npm start and fire up your server.
